She approached it with such artistry and intentionality. Brilliant, patient, diligent, and soulful, Cally had the ability to help guide me in seeking to create unique and deeply meaningful imagery that reflects what I most hope is real in me, in my life, and in my story. She truly has a gift for slowing down time, capturing what can, in ways, feel fleeting in this life, and preserving the inspiration embedded in emotions. I would recommend her as a photographer without reservation.",

My husband was worried about getting family photos taken because sessions are usually long and they often look posed. But from the moment they met to the end of our session, he was sold. She beautifully captured the essence of who we are. Our photos turned out better than I could ever have imagined and we will for sure be using Cally again for all of our family photos.",

Not once during this session did I feel shy, insecure, worried, or anything but excited and confident and I owe that to Cally’s professionalism & welcoming presence. Going through the photos with my husband had us smiling every swipe because they were ALL so beautiful! These photos were exactly the style and mood I had envisioned, and I truly appreciated how down to earth, welcoming, and reassuring she was the entire time. For this, I completely forgot about anything other then my baby and how good I felt celebrating my pregnancy that day with my man. From beginning to end it was the best case scenario, and I can’t wait until our next session!",
